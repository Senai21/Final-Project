        <p>This website was founded in 2024 by me, Senai Hadgu. Soccer Saga is a new business that is ready to blow up. Senai is a 15 year old boy who grew up in Fremont, California then moved to his home country Ethiopia in Africa for 5 years. Senai lived there from 4-9 until I came back to California and now live in Oakland. Senai is heading into his junior year of high school and is ready for the challenges. He aims for his business to be the website for soccer highlights and the best moments of the beautiful game. His idea came from his love for the game. He has been playing soccer for all his life while watching his favorite team Liverpool. </p>
